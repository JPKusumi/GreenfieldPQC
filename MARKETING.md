# JP Kusumi Announces GreenfieldPQC  
## a Free and Open-Source .NET Library for Post-Quantum Cryptography  


**July 16, 2025 –** Acclaimed software developer JP Kusumi today announced the release of GreenfieldPQC, a free and open-source (FOSS) .NET library designed to empower developers with quantum-resistant encryption solutions amid the escalating threat of quantum computing. Launching with a NuGet package and a GitHub repository, GreenfieldPQC will feature NIST-standardized algorithms alongside a novel/original streaming cipher for symmetric encryption with a 512-bit key. This innovative toolkit, offered free of cost or obligation, addresses the urgent need to secure applications against quantum attacks, targeting the global .NET developer community.

### A Response to the Quantum Threat  
Quantum computing’s potential to break current encryption standards—such as RSA and ECC—via Shor’s algorithm looms large, with experts predicting vulnerability by 2030. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finalized its post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, including CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-KYBER, in August 2024, spurring a global race to adapt. A 2024 Ponemon Institute report revealed 78% of IT leaders prioritize PQC, yet only 15% have implemented solutions, highlighting a critical adoption gap. GreenfieldPQC steps into this breach, providing a robust, accessible resource to future-proof digital infrastructure.

### Innovative Features  
GreenfieldPQC combines proven and novel approaches to quantum resistance. It incorporates NIST-standardized algorithms—CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures and CRYSTALS-KYBER for key encapsulation—ensuring alignment with global PQC frameworks. Additionally, Kusumi has developed an original streaming cipher for symmetric encryption, featuring a 512-bit key. This high-speed, quantum-resistant cipher is tailored for real-time data protection, addressing the need for secure communication and efficient encryption in an evolving threat landscape. The library’s .NET integration, supported by comprehensive GitHub documentation, will include code samples, tutorials, and a community forum, embodying the FOSS spirit of collaboration seen in projects like Linux.

### A 30+ Year Career in Software Innovation  
Kusumi’s 30+ year software career, since 1992, underpins this project. Beginning as a quantitative marketing analyst, he automated analytics and developed software for industry leaders including Allied Signal, Boeing, CBS News, Citibank, General Electric, Microsoft, and NCR. His 2018-2019 tenure at Microsoft focused on Azure DevOps pipelines, refining his cloud expertise, while his 2019-2022 role as Chief Software Engineer at NYSE-listed EPAM Systems—serving as a solution architect, tech lead, and project coordinator—culminated with Thomson Reuters as his last client. This extensive experience equips him to deliver a cutting-edge FOSS solution to the developer community.

### Why Now?  
The quantum threat is no longer theoretical. Google’s 2019 quantum supremacy claim and IBM’s 2023 1,121-qubit processor, per Nature, underscore a race to break current encryption, with $20 billion in global quantum investment projected by 2025, per McKinsey. NIST’s 2024 standards provide a foundation, but adoption lags. Kusumi’s GreenfieldPQC offers a timely, no-cost resource, bypassing startup monetization. “The world needs tools to harden encryption against the quantum threat,” Kusumi said. “This is a contribution to the public domain.”

### Target Audience and Outreach  
GreenfieldPQC targets the global .NET developer community, exceeding 1 million members, per Microsoft data. The NuGet package is available via nuget.org, with a GitHub repository providing open-source code, documentation, and a feedback forum. Kusumi encourages tech writers from Wired, TechCrunch, ZDNet, and similar outlets to cover this initiative, focusing on its technical innovation and community impact. “This is about collaboration, not competition,” he noted, echoing the FOSS ethos of Linux’s 3.2 million contributors, per Linux Foundation.

### Technical Highlights  
GreenfieldPQC aligns with NIST’s PQC standards, offering CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-KYBER for signatures and key encapsulation. Its standout feature, the new 512-bit streaming cipher, provides high-speed symmetric encryption, ideal for real-time data protection. Drawing on Kusumi’s EPAM experience, the library ensures compatibility with enterprise applications, with GitHub samples covering secure transmission, digital signatures, and key management. This addresses challenges like key size and interoperability, noted by former NSA cryptographer Roberta Faux, per PostQuantum.com.

### Call to Action  
.NET developers are invited to explore GreenfieldPQC, contribute to its development, and provide feedback via the GitHub repository. Tech journalists are encouraged to contact Kusumi for interviews, demos, or walk-throughs. This FOSS release underscores Kusumi’s commitment to secure innovation, a legacy built from his extensive software leadership.
